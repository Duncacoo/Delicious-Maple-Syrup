# FRC Drive Simulator
*This was built in Linux so there may be an issue that arrives? I have not tested*

## Installation
To run the simulator you need to install a few pieces of software.

> [WPILIB](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) (Make sure to install everything & install VSCode)
